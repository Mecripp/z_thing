# z_thing
A repository for all of zzz's Kerbal Space Program parts

Per comments from zzz on [this post](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43840-Hab-Hub-%28and-other-strange-things%29?p=835419&viewfull=1#post835419), all his parts & models are essentially under a '[dwtfywwi](https://github.com/avar/DWTFYWWI)' license. 

They tend to be scatterd all over the forums and used in many different mods with different uses and capabilities. I thought I'd keep them in a central repository, and perhaps update/maintain them to the best of my ability. I have also set a formal license, MIT, which I think is along the lines of zzz's original intent.
